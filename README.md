**Neko-Box** is a simple **GitHub Action** built to make dynamic Gist displaying your latest activity from AniList.

<br>

## ðŸŽ‰ Usage
**To start, you need to prepare some things:**
- Create a new public GitHub Gist at https://gist.github.com/

- Create an Access Token with the `gist` scope and save it.
You can do that at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

<br>

**After getting this done:**
- Fork this repository.

- Go to your fork's **Settings > Secrets** page add the following secrets:
	- **`ANILIST_USERNAME`** - Your username from AniList.
	- **`GH_TOKEN`** - The access token you saved earlier.
	- **`GIST_ID`** - The ID of your newly created public Gist.  
	 You can find it in the URL and It will look like this:
	 `https://gist.github.com/RangerDigital/`**`d1b79f73d3e5a2420ed370b0059dba42`**.

<br>

**That's It!**  
Now every 10 minutes `schedule.yml` workflow will update your Gist,  
It's now a good idea to pin it in your profile to show off your weeb power level!
